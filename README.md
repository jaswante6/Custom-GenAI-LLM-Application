# GenAI LLM Application

## Purpose
This is a simple application that demonstrates the usage of a pre-trained GenAI Large Language Model (LLM) for generating text responses. Optionally, the application can also utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the quality of responses.

## Features
- Generates text based on user input using an LLM
- Supports optional RAG integration for document-based answers

## How to Set Up
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jaswante6/GenAI-LLM-Application.git
   cd GenAI-LLM-Application
